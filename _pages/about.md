<h1> Bonjour! </h1>
<p> I'm a PhD researcher in Artificial Intelligence, currently researching about Knowledge Representation in Large Language Models at the Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). My Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Pakistan's top-ranked university, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), provided a solid foundation for my academic pursuits. </p>
<p> I am working in <a href="https://xfact.net/"> xfact</a> lab and I am being guided by two esteemed professors -  <a href='https://sites.google.com/a/kaist.edu/song-chong'>Song Chong</a> and <a href='https://jamesthorne.com/'> James Thorne</a>. </p>
<p> Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my research. </p>
