<h1> السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ </h1>
<p> Hi, I'm a first year PhD scholar of Artificial Intelligence at the Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I graduated with a  Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Pakistan's top-ranked university, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), which provided a solid foundation for my academic pursuits. </p>

<p> Currently, I am working in <a href="https://xfact.net/"> xfact</a> lab where I am being guided by two esteemed professors -  <a href='https://sites.google.com/a/kaist.edu/song-chong'>Song Chong</a> and <a href='https://jamesthorne.com/'> James Thorne</a>. My area of research is Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I specifically focus on the following topics:
<ul>
  <li> Adaptive Language models to incorporate new information into their existing knowledge</li>
  <li> Using Reinforcement Learning to generate better responce in Large Language Models </li>
  <li> Knowledge extraction and fact verification in Large Language Models</li>
  <li> Logic and Reasoning in Large Language Models</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my research. </p>
