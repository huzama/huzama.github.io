<h1> Bonjour! </h1>
<p> I am a Computer Engineering graduate from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Pakistan's top-ranked university. I am now furthering my education through the Master's Leading to PhD program at the prestigious Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where I am currently pursuing my PhD in Artificial Intelligence (AI). </p>
<p> My studies at KAIST are being guided by two esteemed professors -  <a href='https://sites.google.com/a/kaist.edu/song-chong'>Prof. Song Chong</a> and<a href='https://jamesthorne.com/'> Prof. James Thorne</a>. My research interests lie in the area of Knowledge and Reasoning in Large Language Models, with a particular focus on developing strategies to enhance their adaptability to new information. </p>
<p> Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my research. </p>
